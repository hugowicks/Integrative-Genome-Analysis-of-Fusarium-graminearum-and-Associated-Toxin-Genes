### Combining files
In the case of Nextseq500 Paired-end reads, every sample is made of 4 files for both forward (R1) and reverse (R2) reads (8 files per sample), which should be combined into two files: one containing all forward reads, and another containing all reverse reads.
This can be easily done using:
A loop-
```bash
code
```
